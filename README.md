# marlowe-doc
Documentation of the Marlowe language and ecosystem. 

The Marlowe team is using this repo for consolidating, organizing and integrating all the Marlowe documentation into one location rather than multiple URLs. We plan to fold it into the main Marlowe web site: https://marlowe-finance.io/

## Top-level docs navigation

Our current top-level navigation structure for the documentation will consist of these categories: 

* Home
* Getting Started
* [Browse Examples](browse-examples.md)
* Tutorials
* Architecture Overview
* Developer Tools
* Enterprise Integration
* Support
