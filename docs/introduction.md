Marlowe, designed specifically for financial contracts, is a low-code, easy-to-learn language that you can use to build and deploy smart contracts on the Cardano blockchain. Since Marlowe is a special-purpose language, it is fairly easy to read, write, and understand Marlowe contracts. 

Marlowe is designed for decentralized finance (DeFi) and supports direct, peer-to-peer lending, contracts for difference (CFD), and other similar instruments. 

## Intended for financial contracts experts

Marlowe is designed to be used by experts in the field of financial contracts or business. They do not need to be programmers. 

## What is a Marlowe contract? 

A Marlowe contract is built by combining a small number of building blocks that describe making a payment, making an observation of something in the "real world," waiting until a certain condition becomes true, and other similar types of concepts.
