## Intended for financial contracts experts

Marlowe is designed to be used by experts in the domain of financial contracts. They do not need to be programmers. 

## What is a Marlowe contract? 

A Marlowe contract is built by combining a small number of building blocks that describe making a payment, making an observation of something in the "real world," waiting until a certain condition becomes true, and other similar types of concepts.
