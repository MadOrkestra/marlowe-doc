The Marlowe Playground is a plug-and-play smart contract builder and simulator that is simple to use, visual, and modular. 

Build, simulate, and analyze Marlowe contracts in this 4-minute tour of the Marlowe Playground.

## Developing, simulating and testing financial smart contracts

Once you have created a contract, you can analyze its behavior through formal verification and testing; for example, you can check whether any payments made by the contract could conceivably fail. You can also step through how your contract will behave, simulating the actions of the participants.

## Choose from three Playground pathways

1. Write directly in the Marlowe language's text format.

2. Use the [Blockly visual programming tool](../getting-started/writing-marlowe-with-blockly.md) to create contracts by fitting together blocks that represent the different components. 

3. Use either the embedded or [JavaScript/TypeScript](../getting-started/using-the-javascript-editor.md) or [Haskell](../getting-started/using-the-haskell-editor.md) editors.
