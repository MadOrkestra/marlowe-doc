## A low-code pathway for building, simulating and analyzing financial smart contracts

Intended to be used by either low-code financial professionals or experienced developers, the [Playground](https://play.marlowe-finance.io) provides methods for building, simulating and analyzing Marlowe financial smart contracts in a sandbox environment using an iterative design process. 

## Choose from three Playground pathways

1. Write directly in the Marlowe language's text format.

2. Use the [Blockly visual programming tool](writing-marlowe-with-blockly.md) to create contracts by fitting together blocks that represent the different components. 

3. Use either the embedded or [JavaScript/TypeScript](using-the-javascript-editor.md) or [Haskell](using-the-haskell-editor.md) editors. 

## Marlowe contract properties

These Playground capabilities, paired with the special-purpose Marlowe language designed specifically for finance, ensures that the Marlowe contracts that you build will have these robust properties: 

* easy and straightforward to build, 
* secure, 
* verifiable, and 
* rigorously tested. 

## Tutorials

We have [tutorials](tutorials/tutorials-overview.md) for you that outline example contracts and show you how to model them.
