## A low-code pathway for building financial smart contracts

Intended to be used by either low-code financial professionals or experienced developers, the [Playground](https://play.marlowe-finance.io) provides methods for building Marlowe financial smart contracts in a sandbox environment using an iterative design process through simulations. 

## Choose from three Playground pathways

1. Write directly in Marlowe text. 

2. Use the [Blockly visual programming tool](writing-marlowe-with-blockly.md) to create contracts by fitting together blocks that represent the different components. 

3. Use either the embedded [Haskell](using-the-haskell-editor.md) or [Javascript](using-the-javascript-editor.md) editors. 

## Developing, simulating and testing financial smart contracts

Once you have created a contract, you can analyze its behavior through formal verification and testing; for example, you can check whether any payments made by the contract could conceivably fail. You can also step through how your contract will behave, simulating the actions of the participants.

## Marlowe contract properties

These Playground capabilities, paired with the special-purpose Marlowe language designed specifically for finance, ensures that the Marlowe contracts that you build will have these robust properties: 

* easy and straightforward to build, 
* secure, 
* verifiable, and 
* rigorously tested. 

## Tutorials

We have [tutorials](tutorials/tutorials-overview.md) for you that outline example contracts and show you how to model them.
